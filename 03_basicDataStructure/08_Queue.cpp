    // Queue = A queue stores multiple elements in a specific order, called FIFO.
    // FIFO stands for First in, First Out. To visualize FIFO, think of a queue as people standing in line in a supermarket.
    //          The first person to stand in line is also the first who can pay and leave the supermarket.
    //          This way of organizing elements is called FIFO in computer science and programming.

    // Unlike vectors, elements in the queue are not accessed by index numbers.
    //        Since queue elements are added at the end and removed from the front,
    //        you can only access an element at the front or the back.
    // NOTE : Queues are often mentioned together with Stacks.

    // Note: You cannot add elements to the queue at the time of declaration, like you can with vectors.
